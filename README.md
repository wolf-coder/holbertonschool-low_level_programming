I am a software developer and a student at Holberton School. I have developed this project as a part of my curriculum and to enhance my skills in low-level programming. You can check out my LinkedIn profile [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fakhri-baklouti-a641b31a1/) and my twitter alias [@wolf-coder](https://twitter.com/wolf-coder)

The project "holbertonschool-low_level_programming" is a collection of exercises that cover various concepts in low-level programming such as variables, loops, pointers, strings, recursion, and more. The project is organized into several folders, each covering a specific topic.

The journey of developing this project has been a challenging one. I started with a basic understanding of low-level programming and gradually built upon that knowledge by implementing various exercises on different topics. I encountered several difficulties along the way, but the most difficult one was understanding how pointers work and how to use them properly. With the help of various resources and guidance from my peers, I was able to overcome this challenge and improve my understanding of pointers.

The project includes exercises that cover a wide range of topics such as variables, control flow statements, functions, nested loops, debugging, pointers, arrays, strings, recursion, static and dynamic libraries, Makefiles, search algorithms and more. 

The project also includes a dynamic library that contains C functions that can be called from Python. This feature is a great tool to allow the user to use C functions in a high-level language like python.


Overall, this project has been a great learning experience for me and I hope it serves as a valuable resource for anyone who wants to learn about low-level programming.
